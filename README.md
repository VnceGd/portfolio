A collection of my work.

Contents:
1. Dyschordia.zip - a zip file of Dyschordia, a 2D platforming game in which enemy attack patterns are synchronized with the music. Download the .zip and launch the .exe inside to play (Windows only).
2. vtn28\_finalProject.png - an 800x1000 poster of the final project I made in Digital Media 100.
